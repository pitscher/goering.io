My portfolio website | [goering.io](https://goering.io)

> This website is based on the [Ryan - CV Resume Template](https://themeforest.net/item/ryan-vcard-resume-cv-template/21584603)
I have customized the template so that it meets my requirements. Feel free to use the changes I made for your own site. :innocent:
But be fair and buy a license if you want to use this template.

## By the way

To deploy new changes automatically I use a self created GitHub Action.
